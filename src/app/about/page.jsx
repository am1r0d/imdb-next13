                Better websites are made up of great individual pages of good
                content. It really is just that simple. The best websites are
                built like a great cookbook. Cookbooks are made up of a bunch of
                individual and specific recipes. Those recipes pages are usually
                laid out in sections to make it easy for everyone to understand,
                no matter what recipe they are on. If you can build the pages of
                your website to work like recipes in a cookbook, you will create
                web pages that search engines love. Here is our recipe for
                building better web pages for SEO.

                When you are getting ready to make dinner, if you are like me,
                you check the fridge for main ingredients you will use to cook a
                recipe. Knowing the main ingredients you have available before
                you start cooking, is key to creating a tasty dish. Are you
                creating a light salad, with just a few components or does your
                dish require depth and lots of prep work? All things you should
                know before you start cooking. A web page or post is no
                different. You need to know the main concept you are planning to
                write about and how much depth and research you plan on putting
                into your content before you start writing.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is a star in every dish you create, be it steak, chicken,
                potatoes or lettuce. Knowing your star ingredient from the
                beginning helps you to shape your dish. For your web page, the
                star ingredient is your keyword phrase. You will use this
                keyword phrase to shape your content, just like the recipe for a
                meal. In preparation for writing your web page, you need to know
                what the keyword phrase is for this individual page, and only
                this page, before you start writing. Determining the optimal
                keyword phrase is known as Keyword Research.
            </p>
            <p>
                Don’t skip this step. If you are not focused on the star
                ingredient of your page, you may end up making content that no
                one wants, competes with other content on your site, or targets
                a very saturated subject. How many tuna sandwich recipes does
                the world really need?
            </p>
            <p>
                When coming up with your keyword phrase, think about what
                someone would type into a search engine to find your page. Most
                people type between three and six words in a search phrase, so
                use that as a guide. Yes, keywords can be phrases, like “red
                onion” or “five-year aged cheddar cheese”, as long as you use
                them consistently in your content. (There is a whole deep dark
                hole on keyword research that we go into here, but for now,
                let’s keep it simple and assume you know the keyword phrase you
                have picked is the perfect one!)
            </p>
            <p>
                Like with any good recipe, you also need to know how much of
                your star ingredient you are going to use. Too much and you ruin
                a dish, too little and you can’t taste it. Know what you are
                writing about and how you plan to highlight your keyword phrase
                before you start. Make sure you don’t go overboard when using
                your keyword phrase. Don’t overuse your keyword phrase and make
                it hard to read your content; use just enough that everyone
                knows what you are talking about and the content reads in a
                natural way.

                Simpler recipes are easier to understand, both for chefs and
                readers. No need to make a 7-course meal here. One dish at a
                time; one topic at a time. By this, I mean to target a single
                keyword phrase per page you create.
